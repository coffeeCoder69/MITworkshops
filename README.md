This is a repository to store rercordings of as many workshops in MIT as possible. This is a open repostiory to benefit anyone and everyone who wants to learn anything. The lockdown, and the new normal of online learning has provided us with the amazing opportunity to have recordings of workshops, which can be referred again and again, and by larger number of people! 

Please note that whie making this repository, we have put as many original links as possible, so that there might not be any concerns regarding loss of Youtube views or reduction in website traffic. Still, if there is any problem, please do let us know by raising an [issue](https://github.com/coffeeCoder69/MITworkshops/issues/new) on GitHub!

If anyone wants to contribute, go ahead and raise an issue!
