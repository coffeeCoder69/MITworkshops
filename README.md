# MITworkshops

This is a repository to store rercordings of as many MIT workshops as possible. This is a open repostiory to benefit anyone and everyone who wants to learn anything. The lockdown, and the new normal of online learning has provided us with the amazing opportunity to have recordings of workshops, which can be referred again and again, and by larger number of people!

PLEASE NOTE that some of the links might not be accessible to you unless you are logged in to MS teams from your learner.manipal.edu account!

If anyone wants to contribute, go ahead!

Format to be followed:

just add a .txt file with recording links, and name the file with name of the workshop. I'll convert it to the required format, and link it to the appropriate place.
